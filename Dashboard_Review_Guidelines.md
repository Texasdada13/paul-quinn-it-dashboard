# Dashboard Review Guidelines

## Review Process

### 1. Systematic Review Approach
- Review each persona's dashboard separately
- Go through each tab in order
- Document all observations, even minor ones
- Take screenshots of issues for reference

### 2. For Each Component, Document:

#### Current State
- What exists now?
- Is it functioning correctly?
- What data is being displayed?
- How is it visualized?

#### Issues Identified
- Data quality issues
- Visualization problems
- Performance issues
- User experience problems
- Missing functionality

#### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Broken functionality, wrong data, security issues
- **High**: Major UX issues, significant data delays, important missing features
- **Medium**: Minor UX issues, nice-to-have features, optimization opportunities
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor enhancements

#### Priority Levels
- **P0**: Must fix immediately (blocking users)
- **P1**: Fix in current sprint
- **P2**: Fix in next sprint
- **P3**: Backlog/nice to have

### 3. Proposed Changes
Be specific about:
- What needs to change
- How it should work instead
- Any mockups or examples
- Technical requirements

### 4. Effort Estimation
- **Small**: < 4 hours
- **Medium**: 4-16 hours (0.5-2 days)
- **Large**: 16-40 hours (2-5 days)
- **XL**: > 40 hours (needs breakdown)

### 5. Impact Assessment
- **High**: Affects core functionality or many users
- **Medium**: Improves experience for specific use cases
- **Low**: Nice to have, minimal user impact
